--- busybox support is under development! --- 

busybox is a stripped down collection of utilities, including a shell (ash), 
than are compiled as one binary.  We are trying to get it built against
UnifyFS so you can 'shell' into /unifyfs, just like you would any other dir.

Quickstart:

1. ./bootstrap.sh and then follow the instructions to make UnifyFS
2. 'make install' UnifyFS.  This puts the UnifyFS librariesin `pwd`/install
3. ./busybox-bootstrap.sh
4. ./start-server to startup the UnifyFS server.  Make sure the paths are
   correct in that script before running.
5. ./start-busybox will start up busybox's ash shell.
